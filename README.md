# Project: Utilizing Eye-Tracking for Empathy-Focused Hiring in Human Resources

The aim of this Python project is to predict individuals' levels of empathy using data collected from eye-tracking. This undertaking utilizes machine learning techniques, including **RandomForestRegressor**, in conjunction with **GroupKFold validation**, to create a predictive model.

### Getting Started

This manual offers you a detailed, sequential guide to set up the project on your local computer, streamlining the process of development and testing activities.

### Prerequisites

To operate this project, it's essential to have Python 3.x installed, along with the following required libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- pickle

###### You can obtain these libraries by running the following command:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn pickle

### Project Structure

The project is organized in the following structure:

    lib.py: Contains utility functions for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation.
    empathy-Dataset-analysis.ipynb: Encompasses the machine learning pipeline, including exploration and illustrative examples.

Usage
To start the project, run the empathy.ipynb file. This will perform data preprocessing, extract relevant features, train the RandomForestRegressor model, and evaluate its performance using cross-validation.

Make sure to include all necessary details to help users understand the project and its operational aspects effectively.
